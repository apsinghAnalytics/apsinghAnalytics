I currently work as a part-time Data Analyst in a construction technology company, where I conduct data analysis of project management and project finance data and build relevant dashboards in PowerBI.

I am actively pursuing a career in Data Science and Analytics with a particular interest in applying these skills within industries such as finance, economics, business analytics, and real estate. Currently, I am dedicated to enhancing my SQL proficiency through practical tutorials provided by [Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/).

In my spare time, I engage in personal projects related to capital markets, some of which I have publicly shared on my GitHub repositories. My ultimate goal is to transition into a full-time Data Scientist role, where I can consistently work with data in areas including stocks, real estate, economics, and blockchain, leveraging my analytical expertise to drive valuable insights and solutions
