I currently work as a part-time Data Analyst in a construction technology company, where I conduct data analysis of project management and project finance data and build relevant dashboards in PowerBI.

I am looking to go further in Data Analytics and Data Science in the fintech industry, and for that, I am currently upskilling my SQL skills with the help of practice tutorials from [Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/). In my free time, I also work on personal projects connected with capital markets, some of which I have publicly shared here in my GitHub repos. I plan to be able to transition to a full-time Data Scientist role, where I am constantly in touch with data from the capital markets: Stocks, Real Estate, and Blockchain.
