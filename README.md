Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aadi, a part-time Data Analyst at a construction technology firm and an aspiring Data Scientist with a strong passion for capital markets. My work involves analyzing project management and finance data and developing insightful PowerBI dashboards.

I am actively transitioning towards a full-time Data Scientist role, with a focus on applying my skills in areas like stocks, real estate, economics, and blockchain. I aim to leverage my analytical expertise to generate valuable insights and solutions, as evidenced by my personal projects, some of which are shared on my GitHub.
