<h3>Hi! ðŸ‘‹<br> I'm <br>a Data Analyst, aspiring Data Scientist, and Capital Markets Enthusiast</h3>

I currently work as a part-time Data Analyst in a construction technology company, where I conduct data analysis of project management and project finance data and build relevant dashboards in PowerBI.

I am actively pursuing a career in Data Science and Analytics with a particular interest in applying these skills within industries such as finance, economics, business analytics, and real estate. Currently, I am dedicated to upgrading my data science skills via a mixt of Kaggle notebook reading, working on personal projects (which I occasionally upload on Github), reading Medium data science blogs, and taking Coursera courses.

Outside work, I delve into capital markets, sharing some of my projects on GitHub. My ultimate goal is to transition into a full-time Data Scientist role, where I can consistently work with data in areas including stocks, real estate, economics, and blockchain, leveraging my analytical expertise to drive valuable insights and solutions
